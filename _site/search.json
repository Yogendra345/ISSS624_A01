We are also interested in visualizing the geospatial features. This is the time we would find plot() of R Graphic very handy as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz,max.plot = 15)\n\n\n\n\nThe default plot of an sf object is a multi-plot of all attributes, up to a reasonable maximum as shown above. We can, however, choose to plot only the geometry by using the code chunk below.\n\nplot(st_geometry(mpsz))\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can also choose the plot the sf object by using a specific attribute as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nplot(mpsz[\"PLN_AREA_N\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap projection is an important property of a geospatial data. In order to perform geoprocessing using two geospatial data, we need to ensure that both geospatial data are projected using similar coordinate system.\nIn this section, you will learn how to project a simple feature data frame from one coordinate system to another coordinate system. The technical term of this process is called projection transformation.\n\n\nOne of the common issue that can happen during importing geospatial data into R is that the coordinate system of the source data was either missing (such as due to missing .proj for ESRI shapefile) or wrongly assigned during the importing process.\nThis is an example the coordinate system of mpsz simple feature data frame by using st_crs() of sf package as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: SVY21 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21[WGS84]\",\n        DATUM[\"World Geodetic System 1984\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",6326]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433]]],\n    CONVERSION[\"unnamed\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"Degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"(E)\",east,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]],\n        AXIS[\"(N)\",north,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1,\n                ID[\"EPSG\",9001]]]]\n\n\nAlthough mpsz data frame is projected in svy21 but when we read until the end of the print, it indicates that the EPSG is 9001. This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nWarning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for\nthat\n\n\nNow, let us check the CSR again by using the code chunk below\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\n\n\n\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common for us to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\nGeometry set for 1359 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6824 ymin: 1.248403 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 5 geometries:\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to re-project preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathematically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nGeometry set for 1359 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 11203.01 ymin: 25667.6 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 5 geometries:\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems.\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\nGeometry set for 1359 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 11203.01 ymin: 25667.6 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 5 geometries:\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now.

We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\n\n1.5.1 Importing the aspatial data\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings <- read_csv(\"C:/Yogendra345/ISSS624_A01/Inclass_Ex/Inclass_Ex01/data/aspatial/listings.csv\",show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings) \n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 4,161 × 18\n       id name     host_id host_…¹ neigh…² neigh…³ latit…⁴ longi…⁵ room_…⁶ price\n    <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1  50646 Pleasan…  227796 Sujatha Centra… Bukit …    1.33    104.

As a best guess, we will assume that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n1.5.2 Creating a simple feature data frame from an aspatial data frame.\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages.\n\nlistings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, \n                       coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                       crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country’s epsg code by referring to epsg.io.\n%>% is used to nest st_transform() to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21 projected coordinates system.\n\nLet us examine the content of this newly created simple feature data frame.\n\nglimpse(listings_sf)\n\nRows: 4,161\nColumns: 17\n$ id                             <dbl> 50646, 71609, 71896, 71903, 275344, 289…\n$ name                           <chr> \"Pleasant Room along Bukit Timah\", \"Ens…\n$ host_id                        <dbl> 227796, 367042, 367042, 367042, 1439258…\n$ host_name                      <chr> \"Sujatha\", \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Belin…\n$ neighbourhood_group            <chr> \"Central Region\", \"East Region\", \"East …\n$ neighbourhood                  <chr> \"Bukit Timah\", \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", …\n$ room_type                      <chr> \"Private room\", \"Private room\", \"Privat…\n$ price                          <dbl> 80, 145, 85, 85, 49, 184, 79, 49, 55, 5…\n$ minimum_nights                 <dbl> 92, 92, 92, 92, 60, 92, 92, 60, 60, 60,…\n$ number_of_reviews              <dbl> 18, 20, 24, 47, 14, 12, 133, 17, 12, 3,…\n$ last_review                    <date> 2014-12-26, 2020-01-17, 2019-10-13, 20…\n$ reviews_per_month              <dbl> 0.18, 0.15, 0.18, 0.34, 0.11, 0.10, 1.0…\n$ calculated_host_listings_count <dbl> 1, 6, 6, 6, 44, 6, 7, 44, 44, 44, 6, 7,…\n$ availability_365               <dbl> 365, 340, 265, 365, 296, 285, 365, 181,…\n$ number_of_reviews_ltm          <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, …\n$ license                        <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, \"S0399\", NA, NA, \"S0399…\n$ geometry                       <POINT [m]> POINT (22646.02 35167.9), POINT (…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides providing functions to handling (i.e. importing, exporting, assigning projection, transforming projection etc) geospatial data, sf package also offers a wide range of geoprocessing (also known as GIS analysis) functions.\nIn this section, you will learn how to perform two commonly used geoprocessing functions, namely buffering and point in polygon count.\n\n\n1.6.1 Buffering\nThe scenario:\nThe authority is planning to upgrade the exiting cycling path. To do so, they need to acquire 5 meters of reserved land on the both sides of the current cycling path. We are tasked to determine the extend of the land need to be acquired and their total area.\nThe solution:\nFirstly, st_buffer() of sf package is used to compute the 5-meter buffers around cycling paths\n\nbuffer_cycling <- st_buffer(cyclingpath, \n                               dist=5, nQuadSegs = 30)\n\nThis is followed by calculating the area of the buffers as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nbuffer_cycling$AREA <- st_area(buffer_cycling)\n\nLastly, sum() of Base R will be used to derive the total land involved.\n\nsum(buffer_cycling$AREA)\n\n1556978 [m^2]\n\n\n1.6.2 Point-in-polygon count.\nThe scenario:\nA pre-school service group want to find out the numbers of pre-schools in each Planning Sub-zone.\nThe solution:\nThe code chunk below performs two operations at one go. Firstly, identify pre-schools located inside each Planning Sub-zone by using st_intersects(). Next, length() of Base R is used to calculate numbers of pre-schools that fall inside each planning sub-zone.\n\nmpsz3414$`PreSch Count`<- lengths(st_intersects(mpsz3414, preschool3414))\n\nWe can check the summary statistics of the newly derived PreSch Count field by using summary() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nsummary(mpsz3414$`PreSch Count`)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   0.00    0.00    3.00    5.96    9.00   58.00 \n\n\nTo list the planning sub-zone with the most number of pre-school, the top_n() of dplyr package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntop_n(mpsz3414, 1, `PreSch Count`)\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 39655.33 ymin: 35966 xmax: 42940.57 ymax: 38622.37\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\n  OBJECTID SUBZONE_NO     SUBZONE_N SUBZONE_C CA_IND PLN_AREA_N PLN_AREA_C\n1      189          2 TAMPINES EAST    TMSZ02      N   TAMPINES         TM\n     REGION_N REGION_C          INC_CRC FMEL_UPD_D   X_ADDR   Y_ADDR SHAPE_Leng\n1 EAST REGION       ER 21658EAAF84F4D8D 2014-12-05 41122.55 37392.39   10180.62\n  SHAPE_Area                       geometry PreSch Count\n1    4339824 MULTIPOLYGON (((42196.76 38...           58\n\n\nFirstly, the code chunk below uses st_area() of sf package to derive the area of each planning sub-zone.\n\nmpsz3414$Area <- mpsz3414 %>%\n  st_area()\n\n\nmpsz3414 <- mpsz3414 %>%\n  mutate(`PreSch Density` = `PreSch Count`/Area * 1000000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.1 Histogram.\nIn practice, many geospatial analytics start with ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’. In this section, we will learn how to use appropriate ggplot2 functions to create functional and yet truthful statistical graphs for EDA purposes.\nFirstly, we will plot a histogram to reveal the distribution of PreSch Density. Conventionally, hist() of R Graphics will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nhist(mpsz3414$`PreSch Density`)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the syntax is very easy to use however the output is far from meeting publication quality. Furthermore, the function has limited room for further customization.\nIn the code chunk below, appropriate ggplot2 functions is used.\n\nggplot(data=mpsz3414, \n       aes(x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`)))+\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"light blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Are pre-school even distributed in Singapore?\",\n       subtitle= \"There are many planning sub-zones with a single pre-school, on the other hand, \\nthere are two planning sub-zones with at least 20 pre-schools\",\n      x = \"Pre-school density (per km sq)\",\n      y = \"Frequency\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.2 Using ggplot2 method to plot a scatterplot.\nFollowing graph is showing the relationship between Pre-school Density and Pre-school Count.\n\nggplot(data=mpsz3414, \n       aes(x= as.numeric(`PreSch Density`),\n           y = as.numeric(`PreSch Count`)))+\n  geom_point()+\n  labs(title = \"Pre-school Density Vs. Pre-school Count\",\n      x = \"Pre-school density (per km sq)\",\n      y = \"Pre-school Count\")"
